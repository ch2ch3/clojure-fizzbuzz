Clojure Fizzbuzz
================
Another day, another language. To get our hands dirty with Clojure, we rewrote [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/ch2ch3/fizzbuzz) in Clojure today. To recap, Fizzbuzz is a counting game where numbers divisible by 3 are substituted with "fizz", numbers divisible by 5 are substituted with "buzz", and numbers divisible by 15 are substituted with "fizzbuzz".

e.g. 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
